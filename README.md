time series analysis and forecasting for furniture sales using ARIMA
Good to see that the sales for both furniture and office supplies have been linearly increasing over time although office supplies' growth seems slightly stronger.

The worst month for furniture is April, the worst month for office supplies is February. The best month for furniture is December, and the best month for office supplies is November.

There are many time-series analysis we can explore from now on, such as forecast with uncertainty bounds, change point and anomaly detection, forecast time-series with external data source. We have only scratched the surface here. Stay tuned for future works on time-series analysis
